# Bash commands
- To find files, use fd command instead of find

# Code style
- YOU MUST write readable code, only write imperative code when you are asked to
- Keep files short and concise, it is preferred to create more files than to keep increasing existing file

# Workflow
- Use test driven development (TDD), write test first, run them, let it fail, do the implementation so that test pass. Don't change test in implementation phase
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
- Break task in small todos before implementation, confirm before implementing todos
